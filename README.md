# CSE-231
#
# Hello! This is my portfolio for my CSE 231 class at Michigan State Univeristy
# during my Freshman Spring 2020-2021 semester. I worked on various projects 
# from begineer to real world situation based. This class helped expanded my list
# of skills and proficiency in Python.
#
# Feels free to message me if you have any questions.
